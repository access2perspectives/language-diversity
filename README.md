Notes: 
- https://info.africarxiv.org/ acceots oreorints in local and regional African languages

## Background:
Experience that not every person speaks english - a lot of knowledge is hidden in local culture that is mostly accessible through local language
-> how does that relate to open scienece?
-> experiences?
     
- knowledge exchange in mothertounge while science takes place in English

- Speaking English as a threshold; still English seems important to include non-(German, etc) speakers -> usefull to have a common language while still be connected to "own" language
- "bigger" languages tend to be analyzed better than "smaller" ones -> lack of access to information
- English as the language of science, esp. in computer sciences -> also form of cultural imperialism
- switching languages take a lot of mental energy
- translating english published articles back into mothertounge in order to contribute to local community
- balancing diversity <-> standards
- feasibility of visual language to transmit scientific facts / input?
- loss of diversity & nuances of meaning by simplifying into one common language
- Wikipedia as a successful model for dealing with multilingualness but also interoperability at the same time 
- an example for multilingual knowledge representation (with challenges): https://openmethods.dariah.eu/

but also shows different approaches on topics depending on language since all article are written individually in each language (instead of being automatically translated)

- language also transports cultural meaning that might get lost through automated translation


## Summary: 
We need language diversity in science.  We need a common language to connect.
balanced use of both while using as much technologie for support as possible
